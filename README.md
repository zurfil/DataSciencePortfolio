This is the future project portfolio.

Some projects on my mind: (subject to change)
- Ensemble clustering with the presence of noise: (Python)
  	My dissertation project. Due to the nature of the collaborative process between a student and a supervisor I would rather not share the original repository containing every file, revision, commit and change in respect to my supervisor's right to privacy. This portfolio contains the complete dissertation project code as it was submitted for grading. This project dives into the idea that small additions of noise into the dataset might force an increase in the diversity of the clustering ensemble, thus enabling it to capture more detail from the dataset resulting in an increase in accuracy. While final results remained not conclusive, there were several cases where this idea turned out to be correct.

- Tableau visualization: (Python/Tableau)
	Download a dataset from kaggle, perform exploratory analysis and prepare it for Tableau.
	Then make a visualization with multiple objects.

- FIFA 22 player dataset exploratory and statistical analysis: (Python/R)
	Use the FIFA 22 dataset to answer different questions about player characteristics-statistics correlation,
	for example:
		- Does the rating/pace/physical tends to decrease as age increases?
		- Display, compare, and check if statistics such as age/height are significantly different between positions.
		- Do height and weight follow a similar correlation in players and general population?
		- Which kit numbers have on average the best rating?

- Coffee orders and customer data: (Excel/PowerBI or SQL/Tableau)
	Use either Excel+PowerBi or SQL+Tableau to join three different datasets (orders, customers, and products) and then
	explore the data to answer questions about the sales of coffee, for example:
		- Which roast sells the best overall?
		- Do people prefer buying small or large coffee sizes?
		- Does the season impact the sales?
		- (if possible) Do same customers stick to the same brand/roast?

- Mall customers dataset for clustering: (Python)
	Perform data analysis and clustering on the mall customers dataset.
	Clean the data from irrelevant information, perform clustering (both single K-Means and ensemble) and compare the
	results with the labels.
