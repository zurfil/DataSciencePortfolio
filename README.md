This is the future project portfolio.

Some projects on my mind: (subject to change)
- Fisharian: (Python)
	Computer Vision AI model used for automatic fishing in Terraira.

- Tableau visualization: (Python/Tableau)
	Download a dataset from kaggle, perform exploratory analysis and prepare it for Tableau.
	Then make a visualization with multiple objects.

- FIFA 22 player dataset exploratory and statistical analysis: (Python/R)
	Use the FIFA 22 dataset to answer different questions about player characteristics-statistics correlation,
	for example:
		- Does the rating/pace/physical tends to decrease as age increases?
		- Display, compare, and check if statistics such as age/height are significantly different between positions.
		- Do height and weight follow a similar correlation in players and general population?
		- Which kit numbers have on average the best rating?

- Coffee orders and customer data: (Excel/PowerBI or SQL/Tableau)
	Use either Excel+PowerBi or SQL+Tableau to join three different datasets (orders, customers, and products) and then
	explore the data to answer questions about the sales of coffee, for example:
		- Which roast sells the best overall?
		- Do people prefer buying small or large coffee sizes?
		- Does the season impact the sales?
		- (if possible) Do same customers stick to the same brand/roast?

- Mall customers dataset for clustering: (Python)
	Perform data analysis and clustering on the mall customers dataset.
	Clean the data from irrelevant information, perform clustering (both single K-Means and ensemble) and compare the
	results with the labels.
