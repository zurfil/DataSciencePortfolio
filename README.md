This is the future project portfolio.

Some projects on my mind: (subject to change)
- Ensemble clustering with the presence of noise:\
  	My dissertation project.\
	This project dives into the idea that small additions of noise into the dataset might force an increase in the diversity of the clustering ensemble, thus enabling it to capture more detail from the dataset resulting in an increase in accuracy. While final results remained not conclusive, there were several cases where this idea turned out to be correct.\
	Results can be found under EnsembleClustering/results path as .png graphs.


- Tableau visualization:
	- Download a dataset from kaggle, perform exploratory analysis and prepare it for Tableau.
	- Then make a visualization with multiple objects.


- FIFA 22 player dataset exploratory and statistical analysis:\
	Use the FIFA 22 dataset to answer different questions about player characteristics-statistics correlation,
	for example:
	- How does the age affect the statistics?
    - Display, compare, and check if statistics such as age/height are significantly different between positions.
    - Make a classifier to predict card quality (bronze, silver, gold) based on player statistics.
    - Make a regressor to predict player overall rating based on player statistics.
    - Make a classifier to predict player position (defender, midfielder, striker) based on player statistics.
    - FOR THE 3 TASKS ABOVE: train on FIFA22 and FIFA21 data, predict on FIFA20 data


- Coffee orders and customer data:\
	Use tools to join three different datasets (orders, customers, and products) and then
	explore the data to answer questions about the sales of coffee, for example:
    - Which roast sells the best overall?
    - Do people prefer buying small or large coffee sizes?
    - Does the season impact the sales?
    - (if possible) Do same customers stick to the same brand/roast?


- Mall customers dataset for clustering:\
	Perform data analysis and clustering on the mall customers dataset.\
	Clean the data from irrelevant information, perform clustering (both single K-Means and ensemble) and compare the
	results with the labels.


- Simple account creation and login/verification dashboard:\
	Make a simple website where one can create an account and later log in to the website.
	- Passwords should be stored securely. (hash+salt)
	- Passwords should be hashed locally before leaving the host.
	- Some account recovery feature?
